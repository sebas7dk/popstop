1
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:08,921
My name is Yasmin.

2
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,839
I am three months pregnant.

3
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,157
It is said that everyone is born equal according to the law.

4
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,622
That is not what happens in my world.

5
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:26,105
Who would want to be born between chaos and hatred?

6
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,547
I decided to protect my child from evil.

7
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,460
FRONTIER(S)

8
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:52,719
My choice...

9
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:55,487
In the second round of the Presidential elections?

10
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:03,641
A massive anger...

11
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,376
...By the actions of the police.

12
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,675
The riots started...

13
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:20,721
...Against the authorities of extreme right.

14
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,829
The situation worsens...

15
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,536
We're almost there, c'mon!

16
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,664
Not so fast!

17
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:53,393
Stop!

18
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,253
A little more.

19
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,719
- Not so fast. - OK.

20
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,188
Stop!

21
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,780
Alex, don't do stupidities!

22
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,757
- What are you doing, Alex?! - Stop!

23
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:44,741
Stop, Alex!

24
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,135
- Do not move! - Alex, stop, for fuck's sake!

25
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:49,616
Now what?! Stand up!

26
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,151
What's going on?

27
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,205
Did you think you were so tough?

28
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,332
Motherfucker!

29
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,116
- Let him be! - For fuck's sake!

30
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,848
Alex, relax!

31
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,683
Run, fast!

32
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,547
- What? - Sami is injured and bleeding!

33
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,507
What have you been doing?

34
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:28,362
Fuck!

35
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,722
- He's gonna die, your brother will die! - Let's take to a hospital!

36
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,583
No, wait for me.

37
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:37,664
Yasmin, do not do anything. Wait.

38
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:40,172
So we sit down and watch?

39
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,357
Can't you understand?! I said you to wait!

40
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,698
- You are an idiot, Sami is injured! - Is it my fault?

41
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:50,932
Sam wanted it.

42
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,310
- We'll go the three of us. - What do you think?

43
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,704
- They went away from us because you hurted her! - Yasmin is my girl!

44
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:00,811
Come on, be careful!

45
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,035
- Farid stop. - This is to remember.

46
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,765
We've arrived.

47
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,341
You have taken too much!

48
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,125
- Where were you? - The streets are filled with barricades.

49
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,722
We must take him away from here.

50
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,942
We don't need him.

51
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,549
- Isn't it risky? - Don't say anything about my brother.

52
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,678
- It was your fault! - And you?, were you on vacations?!

53
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,869
- Idiot! - Calm!

54
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,038
Well, think what we are going to do, okay?

55
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:03,834
- I'll bring him to the hospital! - They'll catch you.

56
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,889
You are right, but what if we don't carry him?

57
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:10,068
- It's not your decision? - Shut the fuck up!

58
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,759
Son of a bitch.

59
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,096
Tom, he needs a real doctor.

60
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,520
Well, this is what we'll do...

61
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:23,540
You go with Farid and then we will meet in a hostel near the border

62
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:27,523
I'll accompany them to the hospital. We will leave him and we will meet with you.

63
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,608
Okay.

64
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,801
I won't go with this idiot. I prefer to die!

65
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,971
It's over, motherfucker. Do what you want.

66
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:38,581
Please.

67
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,619
- Please, Farid Take me with you. - I can not.

68
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:43,414
I do not want to stay here.

69
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:57,344
What do you want?

70
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:00,930
- How do you feel? - I could be better.

71
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,549
What about the baby?

72
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:07,167
Now you care? You no longer cheat anyone.

73
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:11,280
- We can manage by ourselves. - Yas.

74
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,091
It's enough. I will abort and you'll be calm.

75
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:16,508
Do not do that to me.

76
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,990
I do it for myself.

77
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,391
Farid, you are a complete idiot. Do you want them to find us?

78
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:45,016
Quiet.

79
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,269
- How much? - 1125...

80
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:51,399
...plus this and this.

81
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,570
- I suppose you know that is not for us. - There's enough.

82
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,720
- What are you going to do with it? - Why do you want to know?

83
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:03,701
- It is necessary to decide something. - I am not yet dead, son of a bitch!

84
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,872
- She is good with the whole world. - Get in there!

85
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:13,732
Okay, can we go, boss?

86
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,735
Are you going to leave us?

87
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,884
Then we leave.

88
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,938
Good luck, Sami.

89
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:52,064
The authorities have decided an exemplary punishment

90
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,608
for the incendiary. The have sent more police.

91
00:10:54,732 --> 00:11:01,530
Each detainee will be brought to the barracks overall for identification.

92
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:07,974
We will go faster by overthere. If you don't want to run.

93
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,274
- Shut the fuck up! - Hurry up, ok?!

94
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21,196
Don't touch me!

95
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,406
- Can't you go faster? - It's enough!

96
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,540
Hold him.

97
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,919
Just her.

98
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,670
Son of a bitch...

99
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,809
Everything will be fine.

100
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,009
Hold, Sami, hold.

101
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:56,314
- What happened? - Help us, please, I beg you.

102
00:11:57,357 --> 00:12:01,653
- What happened? - Haven't you been aware of the shootings in the city?

103
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,074
- Now I return. - Quick.

104
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,749
Hold.

105
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,627
Yas...

106
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,713
I'll take care of him.

107
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:25,239
Let the baby be born.

108
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,724
Is it worth...

109
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,893
Being a mother... without a future?

110
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:37,521
Fuck them all, it is not their problem. It's your life.

111
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,282
I love you, Sami.

112
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,659
I love you so much...

113
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:53,078
I love you, Yas...

114
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,581
I love you.

115
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:00,336
They're coming.

116
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:05,581
Go away quickly.

117
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:10,034
- I won't leave you! - You have something important to bring.

118
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:13,765
I won't leave you! No, no...

119
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:19,105
Go...

120
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,527
Hey you!

121
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,012
Please, we must ask you some questions.

122
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,472
Stop or we'll arrest you!

123
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,328
Stop!

124
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,958
It is done?!

125
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,448
Move!

126
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:43,337
- What the fuck happened there? - Move!

127
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,653
Stop!

128
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,217
Shit!

129
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,210
They almost grab you.

130
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:56,350
Your brother will sing. We are full of shit.

131
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,519
Sami won't betray us.

132
00:13:58,555 --> 00:13:59,978
He died, Alex!

133
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:08,570
I want you to take me to my house.

134
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,782
I beg you.

135
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,993
I will not say anything, I swear.

136
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:21,144
That was not the agreement. Now we can not retreat.

137
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,782
- I am already calm. - Me too.

138
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,890
We are already well away.

139
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,552
Is this still France?

140
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,064
Yes, the deepest.

141
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:57,368
Is there any better place in this country than this?

142
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:03,625
Did you want to stay in the city?

143
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,711
Maybe.

144
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:11,049
I should have gone to my father's funeral with Bleude.

145
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:12,056
But I was late...

146
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:15,345
And I could not leave the district in time.

147
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:19,954
I said that if I walked out of there again I won't no longer return ever.

148
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:25,354
And there is nobody wait for me.

149
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,481
Not even a girlfriend?

150
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,641
Fool.

151
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:33,185
There's no girl behind.

152
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:39,369
- Why do we stop? - Shut up.

153
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,120
- What? - Get out.

154
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,873
Why?

155
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,335
Out!.

156
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:52,569
- Sorry, but the money stays with me. - What?

157
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:57,784
- But why? - I have said you to leave.

158
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:04,664
I want to relax in your seat!

159
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,303
It hurts me.

160
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:08,861
Stop, don't fool around.

161
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:13,402
- It's the last fucking time I ask you to leave! - Ok, I'm going out.

162
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,741
Don't panic, it was a joke.

163
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:19,867
We'll rest here.

164
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:20,957
Idiot.

165
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:22,776
Don't cry, you have to be a man.

166
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,093
Were you scared?

167
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,107
A little, motherfucker.

168
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,129
Hello?

169
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,340
Tom, it's me.

170
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:39,282
We are on the way.

171
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:44,016
No, it's okay. They have said that he'll survive.

172
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,524
Where are you?

173
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,980
Still three hours.

174
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,274
Until then.

175
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:53,860
Why haven't you said it to them?

176
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,118
There is no need to complicate it further.

177
00:16:57,154 --> 00:17:00,199
You are not alone, We are all involved.

178
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:06,143
I feel sick.

179
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,180
I am going to puke.

180
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:09,906
I think I'll quit.

181
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,794
- Really? - My mother will behappy.

182
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,111
She'll believe that I have matured.

183
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:22,179
- I need to sleep. - Me too.

184
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:26,433
- What sets there? - "Rooms".

185
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:29,102
There is always something free in those sites.

186
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:32,773
Border> <Dachville 2.5 km

187
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:23,969
It costs money.

188
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:28,454
- Man, this is not Panama. - This is the perfect place..

189
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:39,985
Good site.

190
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,101
Good evening.

191
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:50,538
Is there any room for rent?

192
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:55,355
Here everything is possible.

193
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:06,053
- The rooms are free. - Then we will be your visitors.

194
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,648
How much do you have?

195
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:07,205
Much.

196
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:09,661
We will be two more.

197
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,854
- Is it possible a second room? - Three.

198
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:21,360
I must register you.

199
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:23,430
Goetz, a customers!

200
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:26,303
- I can not stand it. - Quiet.

201
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:30,514
Hey, Goetz, are you asleep or what?!

202
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,211
What's going on?

203
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,771
Is the number two ready?

204
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,044
How long?

205
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,171
One evening.

206
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:10,179
Ok, you can stay. Girls, take care of their lodging.

207
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:14,005
Thanks.

208
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,998
- A drink? - It will be a pleasure.

209
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,195
They won't belive we found this two beauties.

210
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,574
You're... incredible.

211
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,108
Very kind.

212
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,162
What's the matter with you?

213
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,694
Dude, this is rare...

214
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:39,312
You're so charming boys. You're a gift from heaven.

215
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:48,385
Do you have something to show us? We're losing time.

216
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:48,801
Won't you have forgotten it?

217
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:53,577
Here comes married people, but I see that you are very emotionally impulsive.

218
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:56,887
I assume he is the leader

219
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,842
Farid, don't tell that silly topics.

220
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:03,295
You are right, Gilberte.

221
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,777
I am impulsive.

222
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,028
I am impulsive here...

223
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:11,407
...And here too.

224
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:24,817
Aren't you ashamed?

225
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,610
No, no. I have a girlfriend.

226
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,893
What's going on? We must reach out to the end.

227
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:36,974
Dude, we have to drive tomorrow All day...

228
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,164
Enough of nonsense! This is something for adults.

229
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,604
Do we continue?

230
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:48,068
I see that you aren't getting bored.

231
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,495
At least they aren't pussies.

232
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:55,054
Gilberte, take them to the room.

233
00:21:57,369 --> 00:21:59,371
Finish there.

234
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:01,749
- Are we going? - Me?

235
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:04,856
You wanted to finish.

236
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:06,740
Claudia, take care of the other...

237
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,588
We'll have a good time together.

238
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,163
We go up at once.

239
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:12,217
No, I am going to call my girlfriend.

240
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:15,971
I promised her.

241
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,454
You do not know what you're losing.

242
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,769
Shit.

243
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:19,117
Fuck, they're sweet.

244
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:22,204
Come here, I'm gonna fix you.

245
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,793
I'm ready...

246
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:34,257
Come, come, come...

247
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:38,637
I have girlfriend!

248
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:47,291
Dude, fuck her well!.

249
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,524
Leave me!

250
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,800
Be a man!

251
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,913
What's going on?

252
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:19,844
I did not think we would have this familiar meal so soon...

253
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,575
It's called "hospitality".

254
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:24,265
Pass the dishes.

255
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:34,859
Thanks.

256
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:37,966
Let's see what you have done in your kitchen.

257
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,698
It will be good to recover forces.

258
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:43,909
Really?

259
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,551
Delicious, what is it?

260
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,512
It is fried pork.

261
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:06,938
You won't freeze tonight.

262
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:10,108
It'll be good for you, you are decrepit.

263
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,981
Sorry, but I don't eat pork. My religion doesn't allow.

264
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:17,449
Are you Jewish?

265
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:20,738
No, I am Muslim. Just I do not like pork.

266
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,700
Girls help me.

267
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,415
Claudia, open her mouth.

268
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,364
Move away.

269
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:36,357
- Mom, make an effort. - Come on!

270
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,173
Mom, open your mouth.

271
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:46,388
Are you cheating us?

272
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:50,685
If you do not open, we no longer help you.

273
00:25:51,393 --> 00:25:53,395
Do you understand?

274
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:57,671
Swallow, shit. I'm gonna get angry!

275
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:03,113
- Didn't she like the food? - What is all this for?

276
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,873
You treat your mother as a dummy.

277
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:11,267
We must help mom, or she'll lose the appetite...

278
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,459
Okay. Well, well.

279
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:19,358
- Are you tired? - I do not like these family reunions, but good profit.

280
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:26,449
- Hey, stay. - What's going on?

281
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:29,931
You were right, Farid. They are whores.

282
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,831
No, no, sorry... I's a joke.

283
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,109
He doesn't know what he's saying.

284
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:39,191
What's the matter with you? Are you sick or what?

285
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,395
She liked me to spank her ass...

286
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,032
And she even wanted more.

287
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:50,138
I told you that they were whores.

288
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:52,291
We went too fast.

289
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:56,624
It hurted me. She mattered to me.

290
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,627
Shit, Yas...

291
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:03,193
They'll kill us. Better don't say anything.

292
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:06,473
Really?

293
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,002
What's going on there? We won't arrive until another two hours.

294
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:12,307
Pretty good. What about you?

295
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,935
Everything was wrong.

296
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:19,106
We had problems at the hospital.

297
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:22,432
I understand.

298
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:25,143
- Are where are you? - In a small hotel, as we agreed..

299
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:28,989
I send you the address by SMS.

300
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,159
Don't say anything to Farid.

301
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,317
Understood.

302
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,371
See you, kisses.

303
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,757
Why do you whisper?

304
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:43,734
- Why are you scared? - For that people.

305
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,633
Fuck.

306
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:48,343
Damned whore.

307
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:08,780
Of these.

308
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:12,283
What's going on?

309
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:15,035
Nothing.

310
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:19,754
Newsflash.

311
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,950
The Minister of Interior is officially Candidate for the presidency of the Republic,

312
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,094
He's the subject of the protests.

313
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:28,863
Instability in the country mark presidential pre-campaign.

314
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:33,721
The police remains in state of maximum alert.

315
00:28:34,556 --> 00:28:36,558
Fart!

316
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,291
I'I strangle them with my own hands.

317
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,735
For them.

318
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:44,195
Country of fascists.

319
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:49,049
France and the USA... Bush govern here for ten years.

320
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:53,579
What do you want?

321
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:56,139
Nothing. Somebody wants to see you.

322
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:01,519
Good evening.

323
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,295
Good evening.

324
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,926
- Do you know why I am here? - Not yet.

325
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,971
Where are you from?

326
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:18,453
From Paris.

327
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:21,894
So you're one of those who burn cars?

328
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,878
Will yo do the same thing here?

329
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,990
Were you lost down the road?

330
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,549
- We're driving to Holland... - I do not speak to you, idiot.

331
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:36,037
Now what?

332
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,494
He says the truth, we are going to Amsterdam to see some friends.

333
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,209
And...

334
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,138
You wanted to fuck.

335
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:45,943
You were looking for some whores.

336
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,712
And you came here...

337
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:51,548
Thinking that this was a brothel.

338
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:55,135
No, wait...

339
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,034
We are just normal people...

340
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,291
- Do you mean that my sisters are bitches? - No, no...

341
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:08,398
- Did you arrive to the end? - What?!

342
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:12,444
Did you? Don't you understand the question?

343
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,990
Did you? Answer.

344
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:22,808
Yeap...

345
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:27,337
Hands up.

346
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:30,092
Hurry!

347
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,510
What have we done?

348
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:35,624
- Gilberte told me that you have a bag with money. - This is madness.

349
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,681
Liar!

350
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:39,137
- It's there. - Gilberte, What do you say?!

351
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,057
This is our clothes, as you can see...

352
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:43,548
Goetz!

353
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,749
We are screwed, fast!

354
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,849
Tom!

355
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:56,946
Stop or I shoot you!

356
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:00,784
Freeze!

357
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:08,459
I said you to stop!

358
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:16,363
- I'll prepare the luggage. - Stop!

359
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,930
Tom, brother.

360
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,640
Do not move!

361
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,792
Goetz, you didnt't killed him!

362
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,329
Catch them!

363
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,670
Fast, to the car!

364
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:59,384
They're shooting!

365
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,482
They chase us!

366
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,485
They chase us!

367
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,415
Hurry, faster!

368
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,921
Drive faster!

369
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,618
Quick, burn the pedals!

370
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,922
Faster!

371
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:05,303
They're by our side! Quicker!

372
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,410
Watch where you go!

373
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,062
- What now? - To the left.

374
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,125
So what?

375
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:03,152
They left the road and fell by the bridge.

376
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,863
I took this.

377
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:10,138
Claudia!

378
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,348
Farid, help me.

379
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,582
Farid, help me.

380
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,961
Farid, I beg you, stand me up slowly...

381
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:56,810
Stand up, with care...

382
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:05,027
Slowly.

383
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:08,864
Carefully.

384
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:12,201
Quiet.

385
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,980
Where are we?

386
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,216
Are you OK?

387
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:58,538
- Good evening. - Good evening.

388
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,063
Some of our relatives stopped here.

389
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:04,920
Are family of Tom and Farid?

390
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:05,967
Are they here?

391
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:09,986
Not really, they went to another motel.

392
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:15,450
- Why they didn't stay here? - We have no vacant rooms.

393
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:17,306
Can you show us the way?

394
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,481
You can follow me.

395
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:23,814
Claudia, you won't join us, You wait.

396
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,197
Come on.

397
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:31,061
Why does she gives me orders?!

398
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:31,659
I can't stand that!

399
00:36:31,696 --> 00:36:35,747
- Obey Gilberte. - I am not her dog.

400
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:39,799
Hold a little! Soon you'll occupy her site!

401
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:50,329
Karl!

402
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:53,097
Goetz! I blocked the road.

403
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:57,117
Get back fast, father does not like to wait.

404
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:14,176
Where are we? Where are we going?

405
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:16,720
I can't stand this smell.. Corpses.

406
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:20,431
Better hold, ok?

407
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:25,041
We should turn around.

408
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,008
Where to? to hell?

409
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,886
We'll try to cross it.

410
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,219
Will you go first?

411
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,889
Come on.

412
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:44,435
1,2,3...

413
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:48,981
Are you OK?

414
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,819
What is there?

415
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,620
I see some lights!

416
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,832
I think I will go behind you.

417
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:12,608
Hey what?!

418
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,272
Go, come on.

419
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:41,951
- Come on. - Shit, I can not breathe.

420
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:44,245
I can not. Come on.

421
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,622
I can not breathe.

422
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:54,254
A little more!

423
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:08,144
Tom, we almost arrived.

424
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:12,689
Go on.

425
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:30,832
- It's over, I'm stucked. - We've almost arrived.

426
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:33,298
- I won't give you more advice. - Neither myself.

427
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:36,170
- Tom try! - I told you I'm stucked!

428
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:40,112
I'm stucked, fuck!

429
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:46,431
Mom, where are you?

430
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:51,228
Mom, I'm dying...

431
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:53,396
Mom!

432
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:58,026
Tom, only a little bit more. Go.

433
00:39:58,902 --> 00:40:00,904
No!

434
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,241
Shit, you will be a man or a pussy?!

435
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,107
I'm stucked!

436
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,161
Go, c'mon! An effort!

437
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,120
¡Ahead!

438
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:12,675
- Go ahead Tom! - We almost arrive...

439
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,169
Come on!

440
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:18,505
Come on!

441
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,954
Tom...

442
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:31,798
Hurry!

443
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,852
Faster, for fuck's sake!

444
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:36,063
Quick!

445
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,901
There's someone behind us!

446
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:42,642
Come on!

447
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:44,697
Fuck!

448
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:01,423
Go out, Tom.

449
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:31,577
- At the end of the road, right. - In what hole are we?

450
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,873
Those were miner wells. They were closed at the beginning of the century.

451
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,545
Do not be in a hurry.

452
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:19,583
I will notify that you have arrived.

453
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:31,112
No!

454
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:33,197
Begone!

455
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,949
No!

456
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:51,382
Don't pay attention to her. She's sick.

457
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:53,177
Good evening.

458
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:55,596
Good evening.

459
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:58,973
Sit down.

460
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,976
Thanks.

461
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:11,089
Claudia, boil some water.

462
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:21,626
This is for hunters.

463
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:24,676
They organize good hunting parties.

464
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:27,408
Where are you heading to?

465
00:44:27,444 --> 00:44:28,508
Towards the Netherlands.

466
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,755
We have some business there.

467
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,965
Do you have a towel, please?

468
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:34,550
Yes.

469
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:40,890
I will bring it to you.

470
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:51,004
- Are you married? - We are no longer together.

471
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:55,780
There is a small door.

472
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:06,018
SURGICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA

473
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:48,832
Are you hungry? Do you want something to drink?

474
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:50,710
Not. Thanks.

475
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,565
Come here!

476
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:15,233
Quiet!

477
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:23,733
He's coming.

478
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:26,792
Claudia, help me.

479
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:29,628
- Who comes? - Father.

480
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:33,752
Stay straight, he dislikes people who relaxes.

481
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:57,859
We welcome you, lady of the road.

482
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:24,177
What's your name?

483
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:28,056
Yasmin.

484
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,851
Irhant.

485
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:34,458
Your hand.

486
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:05,113
Go away...

487
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:08,180
Tom!

488
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:15,187
Go outta here...

489
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:50,806
Run...

490
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,686
Don't stop...

491
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,164
- What's going on? - Get up.

492
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:22,675
- What? - We leave.

493
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:26,590
- What happened? - Let's go to the car.

494
00:49:26,627 --> 00:49:27,138
What is this?

495
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:30,115
- Okay. It is enough. Our friend was killed there.

496
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,000
Alex!

497
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,530
Yas!

498
00:49:34,582 --> 00:49:36,142
Karl!

499
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:58,101
Bring him to the grill and cook him with fat.

500
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:12,699
Listen, son...

501
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:16,870
We must renew the blood of the family.

502
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,753
But I have doubts.

503
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:30,821
I do not know if she is appropriate.

504
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:33,783
She has a too dark complexion.

505
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:40,039
That hair, the eyes...

506
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,272
She does not have pure blood,

507
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,756
But we have no other choice.

508
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:54,323
You need a wife to occupy my seat.

509
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:58,370
She will be your wife.

510
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:06,878
Remember to protect the race.

511
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:06,937
Eve, bleed him, I'll finish him later.

512
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,609
- I will see what's happening over there. - They are the children.

513
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:53,892
Are your children loose by the mine again, right?

514
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,358
I will see what happens.

515
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,918
Surely there's a good meat.

516
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:05,194
I will go with you, Claudia.

517
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,336
Pull!

518
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,857
Stop!

519
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,196
Hurry!

520
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,040
Shit.

521
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:15,139
Stop!

522
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:20,248
Look in the engine room.

523
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,285
Hey little, where are you?

524
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:45,147
Where have you hidden, little?

525
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:49,569
Fuck you, bastard.

526
00:58:01,017 --> 00:58:06,565
I won't leave you, Alex.

527
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:07,071
Yas...

528
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,448
Run for help.

529
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:12,425
- Seek help! - No!

530
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:13,990
No!

531
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,492
Go!

532
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,442
Go away!

533
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:22,122
I said you to go.

534
00:58:22,158 --> 00:58:23,790
Hurry!

535
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,882
Fast!

536
00:58:55,655 --> 00:58:57,657
Move away.

537
00:59:01,161 --> 00:59:03,163
Cross.

538
00:59:43,203 --> 00:59:45,205
Open!

539
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:48,270
Open it!

540
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:04,891
Run.

541
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:08,103
What's going on with you?

542
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:09,896
Hurry!

543
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:20,614
I love you.

544
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:23,889
Escape quickly.

545
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,121
I said you to go away.

546
01:00:34,379 --> 01:00:36,381
Not yet.

547
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:39,718
Go.

548
01:00:40,384 --> 01:00:41,542
Go now!

549
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:44,118
Quick, do not be afraid!

550
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,774
Cross.

551
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:07,578
Go and give notice.

552
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:13,167
Do not you confront with anyone here.

553
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:45,908
Open!

554
01:01:46,784 --> 01:01:48,786
Open!

555
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:41,213
Out, move!

556
01:02:55,269 --> 01:02:57,364
Where is the girl?

557
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,459
Screw you, fucking Nazi!

558
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:05,465
What did you say? Fast!

559
01:03:05,502 --> 01:03:08,573
Bring me the pliers.

560
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:11,415
Don't...

561
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:13,975
What are you going to do?

562
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,083
I will make sure that you won't walk again.

563
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,221
Hold.

564
01:03:33,182 --> 01:03:35,184
So...

565
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:42,045
In Africa, the guards did the same to diamond seekers

566
01:03:42,607 --> 01:03:49,197
to remove the desire to escape for a long time

567
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:07,508
loaded with some brilliants.

568
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:08,054
Not yet...

569
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:08,654
Almost...

570
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:12,533
Finished.

571
01:04:13,638 --> 01:04:15,562
This is the time of pain...

572
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:20,103
And the thieves were still working.

573
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:25,045
They worked!

574
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:32,010
They worked free!

575
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:57,116
Stop!

576
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:05,719
I beg you to help me!

577
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,773
I must call the police!

578
01:06:08,252 --> 01:06:10,672
Come in, lady.

579
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:43,849
This is the wrong road.

580
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:46,331
Not. I'm taking you home.

581
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,335
No!

582
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:54,757
Quiet!

583
01:06:55,674 --> 01:06:57,676
Close!

584
01:06:58,469 --> 01:07:00,471
Leave it closed!

585
01:07:01,472 --> 01:07:03,474
Shut up!

586
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,982
Not...

587
01:07:34,337 --> 01:07:36,339
Hans!

588
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:51,146
Yas!

589
01:07:51,188 --> 01:07:53,815
Superb.

590
01:07:59,738 --> 01:08:02,991
You have a last wish.

591
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,701
Talk.

592
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:09,498
Finish me.

593
01:08:21,635 --> 01:08:24,054
For the family!

594
01:08:34,063 --> 01:08:36,065
Remove it.

595
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:41,591
You have successfully pissed me off.

596
01:08:48,327 --> 01:08:50,850
Take him, Hans, for conservation.

597
01:09:53,267 --> 01:09:56,103
Let's wash her.

598
01:10:17,249 --> 01:10:19,773
You are pregnant.

599
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,215
That's great...

600
01:11:25,317 --> 01:11:28,571
This will give you heat.

601
01:11:30,113 --> 01:11:35,034
You will be soon a member of the family.

602
01:11:43,919 --> 01:11:50,614
You'll sleep in my quiet room until you're ready

603
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,260
Is it okay?

604
01:11:52,386 --> 01:11:56,995
What do you think?

605
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:56,561
I know...

606
01:11:56,598 --> 01:12:03,188
I have something that can help.

607
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:10,659
We are very similar.

608
01:12:10,695 --> 01:12:14,783
Father is happy You are pregnant.

609
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:20,059
Drink.

610
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:26,461
Everything will be more bearable.

611
01:12:26,497 --> 01:12:27,634
Drink.

612
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:31,758
This helps me when I make children.

613
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:38,988
Give me.

614
01:12:39,024 --> 01:12:41,518
Is it strong, isnt't it?

615
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,356
Take.

616
01:12:51,152 --> 01:12:54,718
- More, quick. - No.

617
01:12:54,823 --> 01:12:58,910
In your state you have to be more carefully.

618
01:13:30,107 --> 01:13:36,280
It's beautiful.

619
01:13:36,489 --> 01:13:39,430
You have to cut it.

620
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:46,791
Father doesn't like black hair.

621
01:13:54,174 --> 01:13:57,634
Father said that we are a unique breed.

622
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:03,869
We arrived here after World War II.

623
01:14:05,142 --> 01:14:09,151
I was stolen from my parents when I was small..

624
01:14:09,188 --> 01:14:17,132
They promised me that my parents will come if I was obedient.

625
01:14:17,571 --> 01:14:26,349
Father wants you to madure quickly to bring babies.

626
01:14:26,386 --> 01:14:26,386
Now I am the bride of Hans.

627
01:14:27,372 --> 01:14:30,834
Our children are born sick.

628
01:14:31,419 --> 01:14:33,926
They are deformed.

629
01:14:33,962 --> 01:14:36,798
I'm expecting the fourth, but father said that is by our blood.

630
01:14:38,843 --> 01:14:42,722
Why don't you escape?

631
01:14:42,804 --> 01:14:48,039
I still hope that my parents will come to visit me.

632
01:14:51,605 --> 01:14:53,315
They promised.

633
01:14:53,352 --> 01:14:55,025
I know that they will come.

634
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:58,529
Good children aren't abandoned.

635
01:14:58,565 --> 01:15:00,619
I know what I am talking about.

636
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:03,596
I love children.

637
01:15:08,497 --> 01:15:11,542
Father wanted to get rid of them in the gas chamber.

638
01:15:12,084 --> 01:15:15,301
Before father did that, Hans and I hid them.

639
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:20,363
Now they're living in the mine's tunnels by the side of the farm.

640
01:15:20,551 --> 01:15:25,352
Sometimes I visit them.

641
01:15:25,389 --> 01:15:31,770
I'd die here without them.

642
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:37,710
Here is our guest.

643
01:16:43,425 --> 01:16:51,162
We ask you to sit.

644
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:51,412
Sit all of you.

645
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:12,000
For the new mother,

646
01:17:12,036 --> 01:17:15,707
For our happy and wonderful family.

647
01:17:17,459 --> 01:17:20,817
And the next and happy event..

648
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:25,014
For the birth.

649
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,782
If she's a girl she'lll be named Lilith.

650
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:31,952
If he's a child he'll be named Karl, like his father,

651
01:17:34,767 --> 01:17:41,670
who now will join our dear and beautiful Yasmin.

652
01:17:45,653 --> 01:17:52,139
This wil be a good year of great achievements.

653
01:17:53,953 --> 01:18:00,229
Everyday you'll listen the sound of the wind of victory.

654
01:18:03,129 --> 01:18:08,050
It is time to announce that I have decided to trust the care of our family

655
01:18:11,929 --> 01:18:18,519
to my only son, whom I am proud of, Karl Von Geisler.

656
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:23,236
I ask you to stand up.

657
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:29,237
Thank you, father, This is a great honour.

658
01:18:30,489 --> 01:18:36,245
From now on, you all will respond of your words and actions,

659
01:18:38,455 --> 01:18:44,315
before your brother, my son, Karl.

660
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:54,513
You all must help my beloved daughter, Gilberte.

661
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:00,372
This goes especially for you,

662
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:03,564
Hans.

663
01:19:43,728 --> 01:19:48,233
It seems that you were good friends.

664
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:55,203
You are sick.

665
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,493
It seems that you need more help than me.

666
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:13,764
Gilberte, my beloved daughter,

667
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:19,660
Can you explain to the lady the fate that awaits her?

668
01:20:22,559 --> 01:20:25,916
As I said, we wait for the the child of the lady

669
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:32,590
As a sign of providence.

670
01:20:35,572 --> 01:20:37,355
Besides,

671
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:40,556
he's the only unborn member of our great race.

672
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:54,970
No way.

673
01:20:55,007 --> 01:20:58,052
Be friendlier with father you need to respect him.

674
01:20:58,088 --> 01:21:00,804
You won't teach me what to do!

675
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:05,122
What a great authority of the new commander.

676
01:21:05,309 --> 01:21:07,624
Goetz!

677
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:20,637
Karl!

678
01:21:20,867 --> 01:21:23,599
Tell her to stand up.

679
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:30,523
Stand up!

680
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,819
And now...

681
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:46,287
This will be your sole and new family,

682
01:21:48,352 --> 01:21:51,918
So put an end to these unnecessary disputes.

683
01:22:35,608 --> 01:22:44,971
For the pure blood!

684
01:23:01,342 --> 01:23:03,865
Let me go!

685
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:08,139
- Leave him! - Let me go!

686
01:23:10,267 --> 01:23:14,355
Don't come closer or I cut his throat!

687
01:23:14,391 --> 01:23:15,653
You open the door!

688
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:18,963
- Put the shotgun away! - I'll shoot you two!

689
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,196
I will make you bleed and die as a pig!

690
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:26,846
Hans, lower the gun! It's an order!

691
01:23:26,883 --> 01:23:29,542
Do it, Hans?

692
01:23:29,578 --> 01:23:32,206
Hans, idiot! Lower the weapon, I order you!

693
01:23:33,832 --> 01:23:36,981
- Lower the weapon or I swear I cut you! - Hans, listen to her!

694
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:44,300
I'm not scared of you, slut! Neither of you!

695
01:23:57,773 --> 01:23:59,984
Hans, don't!

696
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:03,383
Don't die.

697
01:24:11,577 --> 01:24:13,684
Kill her!

698
01:24:18,459 --> 01:24:20,670
Karl, here!

699
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:49,615
- We will go by a secondary way. - Wait at the main entrance.

700
01:27:23,185 --> 01:27:25,604
Fucking monsters.

701
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:34,133
I can feel you.

702
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:42,496
Show yourself I said!

703
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:46,521
Little bitch...

704
01:27:57,886 --> 01:28:00,305
Whore, where are you?

705
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:11,817
Bitch, I'm gonna chop you.

706
01:28:26,998 --> 01:28:29,152
Do you want me to disembowel you?!

707
01:28:29,188 --> 01:28:31,305
Do you want me to kill you?!

708
01:28:31,341 --> 01:28:32,216
Come here!

709
01:28:32,253 --> 01:28:35,610
Why do you want me to hurt you? Because you are the wife of our commander,

710
01:28:36,341 --> 01:28:39,073
And now you decide, don't you?

711
01:28:39,803 --> 01:28:42,952
So tell me what I do!

712
01:28:47,977 --> 01:28:50,709
You redneck whore face!

713
01:28:56,277 --> 01:28:58,800
I am more important than you!

714
01:28:58,837 --> 01:29:00,037
Me!

715
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:02,597
Right now I will count on you.

716
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:04,744
Bitch!

717
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:27,787
Who chose you?

718
01:29:34,274 --> 01:29:36,902
Here I command!

719
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:40,112
Only me!

720
01:29:45,701 --> 01:29:48,544
You must obey me!

721
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:52,459
Come back here! I order you!

722
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:54,882
Don't you hear what I say?!

723
01:29:54,919 --> 01:29:58,068
The old man invented everything... Why does he decide who commands?!

724
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:02,176
It's clear who commands! I command!

725
01:30:02,593 --> 01:30:04,986
I command here!

726
01:30:05,023 --> 01:30:06,310
Do you get it?!

727
01:30:06,347 --> 01:30:09,809
Who did he appoint him? why did he choose him?!

728
01:30:10,601 --> 01:30:13,333
I am the commander, I command!

729
01:30:14,397 --> 01:30:16,920
So you should show respect!

730
01:30:17,316 --> 01:30:19,839
Look at me when I speak, slut!

731
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:22,634
Look at me!

732
01:30:23,114 --> 01:30:25,637
Fucking whore!

733
01:33:17,912 --> 01:33:20,821
Drop that, do you hear me?

734
01:33:20,858 --> 01:33:23,731
Drop it, I said!

735
01:33:50,987 --> 01:33:53,093
This is what you wanted...

736
01:34:23,352 --> 01:34:26,084
I... Wanted your help...

737
01:34:27,231 --> 01:34:29,962
- Eve, you come with me. - No.

738
01:34:29,983 --> 01:34:32,820
I can not abandon the children.

739
01:34:32,856 --> 01:34:33,686
Escape.

740
01:34:33,737 --> 01:34:36,480
They are seeking you. I'll say that I have not seen you.

741
01:34:36,517 --> 01:34:38,116
Go! Hurry!

742
01:36:08,623 --> 01:36:11,573
Claudia, she's here!

743
01:36:52,751 --> 01:36:55,029
Claudia!

744
01:36:55,066 --> 01:36:57,308
The two together!

745
01:37:10,309 --> 01:37:12,833
Is this enough!

746
01:37:13,522 --> 01:37:16,775
Go away

747
01:39:01,629 --> 01:39:05,612
Is it the end?

748
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,310
Is it because it's the end?

749
01:39:10,346 --> 01:39:13,391
- Begone! - Do not do that!

750
01:39:13,431 --> 01:39:16,351
- Move away! - Don't!

751
01:39:16,387 --> 01:39:19,091
Eve, move away!

752
01:39:19,128 --> 01:39:21,795
- Don't! - Idiot!

753
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:25,069
Bitch, on your knees!

754
01:39:37,497 --> 01:39:38,561
- Gilberte don't do that! - You are dead!

755
01:41:24,813 --> 01:41:24,938
- We'll leave. - No.

756
01:41:26,855 --> 01:41:27,606
Here are my children.

757
01:42:16,071 --> 01:42:19,992
The disturbances related to the second round of presidential

758
01:42:20,028 --> 01:42:23,914
frustate the access to the power of the candidate of the extreme right.

759
01:42:25,874 --> 01:42:30,795
Yesterday afternoon, after announcement of the results, that was visible on his face.

760
01:42:30,832 --> 01:42:34,049
The police is still in a state of maximum alert..
